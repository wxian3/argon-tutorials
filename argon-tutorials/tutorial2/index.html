    <h2>A Simple Geo example</h2>
    <p>This example takes the current location of the viewer, and positions a cube at a well known nearby location (the Georgia Tech campus, for us), and creates a second cube a small distance away from where the viewer was positioned when the example was loaded.  We do this by adding a small amount to our current east-west location, in the local Three.js cartesian coordinates.  This illustrates how to create geospatial content based on the current location, and update the internal geospatial location of the object.</p>
